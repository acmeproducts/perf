bugs
tap on triangular area moves two images at a time instead of 1 - regression error compared to index.html

bottom of screen: when swiping to trash stack (recycle) the visual queue of the edge glow is not visible longstanding bug doesn't work in index.html - size of viewport is misstated so the true bottom is never visable.

P1 - Footer module toggle task (ui-v8.html)
Badge toggle tries to hide the footer but `ChromeModules.getNode('footer')` caches the very first `.app-footer` in the DOM, which belongs to the hidden provider/auth screens. When cartridges with `footer: false` call `toggleFooter()`, the class change is applied to that hidden footer and never touches the visible footer inside the active `.app-screen`, so the badge never disappears. Create a dedicated task/PR to update the ChromeModules helper so it targets the footer(s) inside the active screen (query all `.app-screen.is-active .app-footer` elements and iterate when toggling) and verify that cartridges that disable the footer now hide the visible badge.

UX Improvement/Simplification
remove the hub zone in the center of the screen instead clicking on item#/# of items button is the toggle to enter and exit focus mode


Search Enhancements/Fixes
Expanded Search Scope: The search functionality now indexes across filenames, dates, time, tags, notes, and all embedded PNG metadata.
Three-Pass Search Logic: The search algorithm now follows a specific order of operations:
Filters by special modifiers (#favorite, #quality, #content).
Filters the remaining results by positive keywords (e.g., landscape).
Applies exclusion filters to the final set (e.g., -portrait).
Empty Search Results: Fixed an issue where the grid would not correctly display an empty state. It now shows a "0" count and an empty grid when a search yields no results.
Search Help Icon: Added an informational "i" icon next to the search bar. Hovering over it displays a list of clickable special modifiers that can be appended to the current search query.
On laptop helper that pops up by mousing over "i" disappears when the user goes to select #favorites as an example, but on mobile it works fine - open to suggestions maybe on mouse over it opens and when user clicks #<special search term> it closes when it appends the special search term to the existing search query or the used can x out to close it
Search results are automatically selected with a blue outline, the user must explicity click on the x on the items selected pill counter to cancel the search and clear the search field.

Tagging UI
Immediate Tag Display: When adding tags in the bulk-edit modal, hitting "Enter" now immediately displays the new tag as a chip and updates all other selected images, the user hits x to exit there is no need for apply or cancel buttons
Tag Removal: Each newly created tag chip includes an "x" icon, allowing it to be removed immediately after being added and appears in the recently used list of tags under the tag entry screen

Modal Functionality - currently not implemented correctly
Draggable & Resizable Modals: Both the Details Modal and the Grid Modal modified to be fully draggable and resizable.

Modal Reset:- currently not implemented correctly
Double-clicking the title bar of the Details Modal resets it to its maximum size.
Double-clicking the title bar of the Grid Modal resets it to a full-screen view and scrolls to the top.

ui-v8 next-version prep
Read `ui-v8-next-steps.md` for the current assessment, then implement the listed task stack (module defaults + telemetry, MLPUM batch restore, gesture tutorial cues, footer auto-hide, persistence smoke harness) as separate, mergeable PRs so the tester never has to resolve conflicts again.
