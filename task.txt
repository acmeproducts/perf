Search Enhancements
Exclusion Queries: Implemented the ability to prefix search terms with a hyphen (-) to exclude items matching that term from the results.
Expanded Search Scope: The search functionality now indexes across filenames, dates, tags, notes, and all embedded PNG metadata.
Favorite & Rating Queries: Added special search modifiers:
#favorite to filter for all favorited images.
#quality:X to filter for images with a specific quality rating (e.g., #quality:5).
#content:X to filter for images with a specific content rating (e.g., #content:3).
Three-Pass Search Logic: The search algorithm now follows a specific order of operations:
Filters by special modifiers (#favorite, #quality, #content).
Filters the remaining results by positive keywords (e.g., landscape).
Applies exclusion filters to the final set (e.g., -portrait).
Search Help Icon: Added an informational "i" icon next to the search bar. Hovering over it displays a list of clickable special modifiers that can be appended to the current search query.
Empty Search Results: Fixed an issue where the grid would not correctly display an empty state. It now shows a "0" count and an empty grid when a search yields no results.

Tagging UI
Immediate Tag Display: When adding tags in the bulk-edit modal, hitting "Enter" now immediately displays the new tag as a chip.
Tag Removal: Each newly created tag chip includes an "x" icon, allowing it to be removed immediately after being added.

Modal Functionality
Draggable & Resizable Modals: Both the Details Modal and the Grid Modal modified to be fully draggable and resizable.

Modal Reset:
Double-clicking the title bar of the Details Modal resets it to its maximum size.
Double-clicking the title bar of the Grid Modal resets it to a full-screen view and scrolls to the top.
