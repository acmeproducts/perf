# V2 Score Compliance Scorecard

## Executive Summary
- A syntax error inside `TagService.addTag` prevents the script from loading, so no checklist requirement executes.
- Operational flows cannot start because the UI fails before authentication renders.
- Sync validation is impossible without a running application.
