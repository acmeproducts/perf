Instructions for updating poc.html per current session:
1. Implement the full performance-v1-sync-plan.txt specification using inline Blob-based workers; keep the app single-file.
2. Redesign IndexedDB with a purpose-built schema, dropping old data; ensure it supports heavy queues, batching, and LRU caches for PNG metadata.
3. Optimize for rapid, high-volume workflows (fast triage, bulk favorites moves, mass tag/note updates) while keeping UX responsive.
4. Maintain "silent promises kept"—avoid intrusive UI unless troubleshooting requires it.
5. Deliver a complete end-to-end solution—no stubs, placeholders, or incomplete flows.
6. Preserve decentralized updates to avoid sidecar bottlenecks and keep network interactions minimal, simple, and well-justified.
7. Do not alter storage provider selection, authentication, folder selection UI, or the established look and feel.
8. Persist PNG-extracted metadata in IndexedDB with LRU eviction to skip redundant network calls; extraction may run in a separate worker to reduce UI impact.
9. Update release comments and footer with the new UTC timestamp, bumped version, and a concise description of the changes.
