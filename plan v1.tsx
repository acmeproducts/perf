feature/bug to develop
Quick Move" feature. This includes creating the previouslyViewedStack state variable and the four 75px peripheral tap zones for instant, single-tap moves to the last-viewed stack. this intended to prevent swipe fatigue. it does not replace swipe on center stage IT supplements it 

Flow: Focus Navigation) * Value Add: Functionality. * Incremental Change: Implement "Focus Mode Navigation." This adds the three invisible vertical tap zones (Left 40% for Previous, Right 40% for Next, Center 20% for Exit) that are active only in focus-mode. again this is a complimentary feature to prevent swipe fatigue so well in focus mode instead of swiping left or right these are content left or right or tap center to exit focus mode 

tags must be black colored font in the details tab, tags already assigned are above the tag entry input field tags used in the session are displayed below the tag input field for quick add with single tap. for bulk tag assignment same as the tags tab exactly including the tag delete with x in the tag chip for assigned tags which are displayed above the tag entry field 

notes font color is black

improve/correct search it is inconsistent the same search term will yield a different item count when the same term was used earlier with no changes to the active stack 

change export to use the data in local storage/memory not cloud, simplify running with just a counter no need for a verbose readout for each item, a success fail count as a running counter will work.

remove footer and in its place move folder/filename in its place that way filename is displayed for both focus mode and normal center stage module

add a single star toggle at the bottom center that persists in both focus and normal mode that if activated sets favorite=yes and is stored in metadata for recall, in search mode allow #favorite as a search entry for the current stack 


the bottom edge swipe sequence is not firing or is being covered up.
